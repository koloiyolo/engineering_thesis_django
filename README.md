  * DBSCAN [#6](https://github.com/koloiyolo/engineering_thesis_django/pull/6),
  * HDBSCAN [#6](https://github.com/koloiyolo/engineering_thesis_django/pull/6).
* System discovery (based on IP Ranges). [#4](https://github.com/koloiyolo/engineering_thesis_django/pull/4)
* Managed system automatic health checks (Using ICMP Ping).
* Notifications on incidents.
* Basic CRUD operations regarding system, location and incident management.
* Audit Log. [#5](https://github.com/koloiyolo/engineering_thesis_django/pull/5)
* Log records CSV export. [#8](https://github.com/koloiyolo/engineering_thesis_django/pull/8)
